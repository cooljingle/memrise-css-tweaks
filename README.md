# Memrise CSS Tweaks
My effort to make memrise a little nicer to use, the changes are mainly around reducing whitespace to have things fit on the page better.

### Installation

The easiest method is through an extension/add-on on chrome/firefox:

- Chrome: install the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) extension
- Firefox: install the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) add-on

Then add the script using the following link: https://github.com/cooljingle/memrise-css-tweaks/raw/master/Memrise_CSS_Tweaks.user.js
