# Memrise CSS Tweaks
My effort to make memrise a little nicer to use, the changes are mainly around reducing whitespace to have things fit on the page better.

### Installation

The easiest method is through the Tampermonkey [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) / [firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/).

Then add the script using the following link: https://github.com/cooljingle/memrise-css-tweaks/raw/master/Memrise_CSS_Tweaks.user.js
